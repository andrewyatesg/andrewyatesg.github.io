    - title: Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow
      institution: Caltech Institute For Quantum Information And Matter
      year: 2021
      advisors: John Preskill
      coadvisors: Sepehr Nezami
      description:
        - Supported by the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship.  
        - Gave a talk at the MURI Annual Meeting 2021 for Quantum Codes, Tensor Networks, and Quantum Spacetime.  
        - Studied the effects of noise on ‘quantum gravity in the lab’ experiments, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01064. Using quantum information and random matrix theory, predicted unexpected noise-resilience caused by special operator-scrambling behavior. Developing a quantum error correction strategy that restores the teleported state to its noiseless form.  
    
    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Cornell University
      year: 2020  
      advisors: Paul Ginsparg, Peter McMahon
      coadvisors: Eliott Rosenberg, Thomas Hartman
      description:
        - Implemented a quantum algorithm to prepare thermofield double states of the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model. This algorithm consisted of the Jordan-Wigner transformation and an adiabatic, trotterized Hamiltonian simulation of SYK. Developed methods for measuring the von Neumann and Rényi entropies of such systems.  

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Cornell University
      year: 2019-2022
      advisors: Peter McMahon
      coadvisors: Logan Wright
      description:  
        - Created and simulated a circuit-model quantum reservoir ML algorithm. Discovered that it is equivalent to a dual classical neural network, where the layer size grows exponentially with its depth.
        - Simulated ‘noise-resilient quantum circuits’ which are ‘Markovian’ and ‘locally rapidly mixing’. Created methods to diagnose and catalogue circuits with these properties. Found tensor network descriptions of the same phenomena which provided elegant analytic tools.
        - Mentored undergrads in Peter McMahon’s group who are working on quantum machine learning projects.
