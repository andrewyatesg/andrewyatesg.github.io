Hi, I'm Andrew Yates. I am a PhD student in theoretical physics at Harvard University, where I am part of [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/). I am part of the inaugural class of Harvard's new [quantum doctoral program](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-launches-new-ph-d-program-in-quantum-science/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum information theory, and fundamental physics. Specifically, I am exploring how quantum computers can simulate complex physical systems that are important for understanding fundamental questions in physics. 

Before starting my PhD, I studied physics and computer science at Cornell. There, I worked with [Peter McMahon](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/) on exponential speedups achievable by quantum reservoir computing algorithms. I also collaborated with [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) at Caltech to study near-term quantum circuits that are holographically dual to traversable wormholes. See my CV for details!

This website is a work in progress. Please check back for updates!
